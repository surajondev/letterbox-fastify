    "overview": "In a small college town, a recent spate of grisly slayings dubbed the \"sorority house murders\" has led to rumors of a so-called \"blood cult\" at large, composed of a number of prominent local citizens. Despite the main perpetrator having apparently jumped to their death, the gruesome murders continue unabated, with each victim bearing the signature of the cult — a golden amulet depicting a dog's head left at the scene. Returning to his hometown following the murder of his brother, Michael begins to suspect that the blood cult may have had something to do with his sibling's grim demise. Finding the authorities ineffectual, Michael teams up with his elderly childhood neighbor Gracie Moore — whose husband has recently fallen prey to the cult — and together the pair hatch a plan to put an end to the gruesome goings-on.",

The hand, for this, is essential. He praises it at the start. “There are the five fingers. The five senses. The five parts of the world (…). The true condition of man is to think with his hands. Jean-Luc Godard composes a dazzling syncopation of sequences, the surge of which evokes the violence of the flows of our contemporary screens, taken to a level of incandescence rarely achieved. Crowned at Cannes, the last Godard is a shock film, with twilight beauty.",

Over the course of the summer, good days would occur sparsely and sporadically; on these days, Hayes would bring his camera outside to film the beauty of his environment, despite knowing full well that the dejection would soon return. “A Florida Melancholy” is a landscape film of emotional survival, comprised of the footage that Hayes shot while in Florida throughout the darkest season of his life, during which all that he could rely on for hope & direction were his camera, and his surroundings.",

That’s what Ryan discovers — the hard way — when he thought hitting the road would solve all of his problems, instead it was just the beginning.

These two elements suggest an implicit comparison between the treatment of space in Renaissance art and the moving image. The film marks a critical development in the artist's work in that he repeatedly employs a series of rapid pans and upward tilts along the city's buildings or facades, often integrating glimpses of his own face. As Beavers notes in his writing on the film, the camera movements are tied to the filmmakers' presence and suggests his investigative gaze.",

Shot in stunning color and set in a suburb of Tokyo where housewives gossip about the neighbors’ new washing machine and unemployed husbands look for work as door-to-door salesmen, this charming comedy refashions Ozu’s own silent classic I Was Born, But . . . to gently satirize consumerism in postwar Japan.",
