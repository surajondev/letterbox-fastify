Shot in stunning color and set in a suburb of Tokyo where housewives gossip about the neighbors’ new washing machine and unemployed husbands look for work as door-to-door salesmen, this charming comedy refashions Ozu’s own silent classic I Was Born, But . . . to gently satirize consumerism in postwar Japan.",

The success transformed Jackson into a dominant force in global pop culture. In 2009, it became the first music video inducted into the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\". \"Thriller\" was also Jackson's seventh and final U.S. Hot 100 Top 10 hit from the Thriller album.

However, at all times Seiya and the others can feel an evil cosmo emanating from Loki and the other Odin Saints called God Warriors. Shiryū, in particular, notices a familiar cosmo coming from Midgard, a mysterious, masked God Warrior. Dolbar makes it clear that he is trying to take control of both Asgard and the Sanctuary, imprisoning Athena in a strange dimension within the giant statue of Odin. Midgard reveals himself as Hyōga and tries to kill Shiryū to prove himself to Dolbar.

When Julius Caesar gets wind of the project succeeding, he has the building site attacked by his troops in order to win the bet and not lose face.

    "overview": "A Minion, longing for a puppy, humorously tries to catch a dog, a squirrel, and even a ladybug, but none of his attempts succeed. Just as his hopes fade, a tiny UFO swoops down and abducts the ladybug. The Minion watches in fascination as the UFO, making adorable beeping noises, forms an unexpected bond with him, becoming his new \"puppy.\" They share fun adventures, with the UFO using its space powers to entertain, playing music and enlarging snacks like cheese puffs and bananas.  One evening, the UFO puppy shows the Minion its home in the stars and expresses a longing to return. The Minion, determined to help, sends an email with their picture to the UFO's home planet, triggering a rescue party. Before leaving, the UFO uses its grow-ray to enlarge the ladybug into a puppy-sized companion. The Minion, surrounded by friends, joyfully accepts the new “puppy,” ready for more adventures together.",

    "overview": "Covered in ice and snow, Elior Forest is the home to dangerous magical beasts and 50 elves frozen in ice. One day, the great spirit Puck helps a young girl break out of her ice prison. Her name is Emilia, a half-elf born with silver hair, long ears, and amethyst eyes—features that resemble the evil Witch who destroyed half the world long ago.  Shunned by society because of her appearance, Emilia dwells in the forest with Puck as her sole companion and family. Burdened with a sin of destruction she does not remember committing, she spends her days trying to find a way to help her frozen kin. But when the great spirit Melakuera, the Arbitrator of the world, finds Emilia, her right to stay alive is brought into question. Will the bonds of ice she formed with Puck prove to be the warm thread that defies fate?",
