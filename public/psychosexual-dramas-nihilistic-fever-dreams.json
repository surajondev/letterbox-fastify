There have been some memorable puppet-theatre performances of opera, but with Caligula Le Po√®me Harmonique and Arcal invite us to savour something quite original by bringing together two artistic traditions that have long been separated: those of Venetian opera and Sicilian puppet-theatre. On stage, the singers and instrumentalists, conducted by Vincent Dumestre, lend their voices and rich sound to the pupi of Mimmo Cuticchio, large stick-puppets belonging to a great theatrical tradition dating back to the seventeenth century.",

In creating these new sequences, Kremer comes to recognize that the exercise effortlessly draws cultural and historical parallels in twentieth-century American life that echo in present-day America. The editorial mashups weave a tangled web of social and cinematic history that root our notions of Americana in the mythology of the desert. As Kremer expounds in his narration on these often astonishing and sometimes shocking associations, his very personal ties to the subject matter become manifest.",

Steven joins him. They start a conversation about cigarettes and coffee. Steven likes to drink coffee before he sleeps, so he can dream faster. The conversation jumps around. \"You know my mother?\" asks Roberto. Steven describes coffee Popsicles. They switch seats; then switch back. Steven has to leave for a dental appointment he's not looking forward to. Roberto makes a startling offer, inspired no doubt by the coffee and cigarettes.",

    "overview": "Pier Paolo Pasolini sets out to interview Italians about sex, apparently their least favorite thing to talk about in public: he asks children if they know where babies come from; asks old and young women if they support gender equality; asks both sexes if a woman's virginity still matters, what do they think of homosexuality, if divorce should be legal, or if they support the recent abolition of brothels. He interviews blue-collar workers, intellectuals, college students, rural farmers, the bourgeoisie, and every other kind of people, painting a vivid portrait of a rapidly-industrializing Italy, hanging between modernity and tradition ‚Äî toward both of which Pasolini shows equal distrust.",

Twenty years later, Fun has become a streetwalker. The three generations finally come face-to-face at the police station. Her father laments that his generation should be ousted while Fun‚Äôs generation has been sacrificed, leaving the future for the next generation to establish. Zhu carefully depicts the shame of selling one‚Äôs body without passing judgment while he finds balance and reflects on the pain in the age of progress. Even though the production was far from lavish, Zhu‚Äôs astute handling of the narrative and mise-en-sc√®ne makes this a vivid and exciting film to watch.",

Switching to lively organ accompaniment, the film pours out a stream of simple scratchings that rollick across the screen. Fish, breasts, flowers, boats, water, lips, hearts, stars‚Äîthe hieroglyphs explode with color and celebrate the female creative force. The surge slows with the return of ritual drumming, this time with chanting, and a self-reflective coda. -- National Film Preservation Foundation",

Many of history's monumental thinkers, such a Pythagoras, Kepler, Leonardo DaVinci, Tesla, and Einstein, have come to the threshold of this great mystery.

Making use of British, Soviet and American footage, the Ministry of Information‚Äôs Sidney Bernstein (later founder of Granada Television) aimed to create a documentary that would provide lasting, undeniable evidence of the Nazis‚Äô unspeakable crimes. He commissioned a wealth of British talent, including editor Stewart McAllister, writer and future cabinet minister Richard Crossman ‚Äì and, as treatment advisor, his friend Alfred Hitchcock. Yet, despite initial support from the British and US Governments, the film was shelved, and only now, 70 years on, has it been restored and completed by Imperial War Museums under its original title \"German Concentration Camps Factual Survey\".",

Stunning black and white camera work by Ian Wilson brings to life this ‚Äúchilling fable‚Äù by Max Steuer, a lecturer (now Reader Emeritus) at the London School of Economics. Avoiding easy answers, The Committee uses a surreal murder to explore the tension and conflict between bureaucracy on one side, and individual freedom on the other. Many films, such as Total Recall, Fahrenheit 451 and Camus‚Äô The Stranger, see the state as ignorant and repressive, and pass over the inevitable weaknesses lying deep in individuals. Drawing on the ideas of R.D. Laing, a psychologically hip state faces an all too human protagonist.",

The utterance of these words of damnation not only cost him his life, but then cast blackness on future generation. Five hundred years later we see the society of Arkham, which is perpetually in the midst of devastation, civil war and mayhem. Modern woman Elena happens across the old text and again unleashes the dark force. This film has been praised as the best cinematic retelling of a Lovecraft tale, as well as innonvative lighting, excellent editing, which director Ivan Zuccon (UNKNOWN BEYOND, THE SHUNNED HOUSE) did himself.",

Harris captures it all on tape: A portrait of a true outsider. Harris shot a dramatic piece, \"Beaver Kid 2\" based on the documentary; This interpretation of the story, made in 1981 on a home video camera with a budget of $100, features a young Sean Penn as \"the Beaver Kid\". Still possessed, Harris then rewrote the script, cast up-and-comer Crispin Glover in the lead, and created the final segment, \"The Orkly Kid\", with funding from the American Film Institute. The trilogy unveils the inner world of a fantastic character in three incarnations.",
